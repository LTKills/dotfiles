# dotfiles
Configuration files automation

If you ever had to format your PC more than twice in a week you know that configuring everything is painful.
But even if you aren't insane enough to format your PC once every hour, you probably spend a couple of hours
configuring it after formating.
What I tried to do is assemble a list of my dotfiles (configuration files) and write a script that copies
and pastes everything into place.
